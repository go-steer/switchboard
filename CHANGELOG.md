## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial scaffold: distroless multicall binary (`serve` / `version`).
- `pkg/daemon` — thin client for the frozen core-agent daemon contract
  (create / inject / wake / SSE stream), with `X-Asserted-Caller` per-turn
  attribution.
- `pkg/chat` — provider-neutral `Adapter` interface and normalized
  `Message` / `Reply` types.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — switchboard chat-gateway design (W1 of the Hermes
  replacement epic).
